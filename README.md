# rainmap-lite
Rainmap Lite - Responsive web application that allows users to launch Nmap scans from their mobiles/tablets/web browsers!

Unlike it's predecessor [1], Rainmap-lite does not require special services (RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Celery, supervisor, etc) to make it easy to install on any server. You simply need to install the Django application and add the cron polling task to set up a new scanning server. Nmap scans on the road for everyone!
